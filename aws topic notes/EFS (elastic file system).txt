								**EFS (elastic file system)**

=======================================================================================================================================================================

**EFS-(elastic file system):-
   1.EFS stands for Elastic File System, which is a scalable and fully-managed file storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
   2.It provides a simple and flexible interface for creating and managing file systems, allowing multiple instances to access the same file system simultaneously.
   3.With EFS, you can easily store and share files across multiple instances, containers, and serverless functions, without worrying about the underlying 
     infrastructure or capacity planning.
   4.EFS automatically scales up or down the storage capacity as per your application needs, and also provides high availability and durability of your data.
   5.EFS supports multiple file access protocols such as NFSv4, which enables you to access your file systems from on-premises or cloud-based instances. Additionally,
     EFS also supports file locking, encryption at rest, and seamless data migration between file systems, making it a highly versatile and reliable storage solution 
     for your applications in the AWS cloud.

**practical:-
    1.create a two instances
          1.EFS-01 / EFS-02
          2.give the machine amazon 
          3.select keys-pair
          4.and give the security group like ssh,NFS-anywhere
          5.create a instance

    2.click on EFS
           1.create a file system
           2.vpc-default
           3.regional
           4.next
           5.virtul private cloud -default vpc
           6.there is a sg group default . we can add our sg group
           7.next and create 

    3.access EFS-01
           1.ec2-user
           2.mkdir efs
           3.yum install amazon-efs-utils -y
           4.then go to EFS and attach --mount via DNS
           5.then copy EFS mount helper and paste on the EFS-01
           6.ls
           7.cd efs
           8.touch file file2 file3
           9.ls

    4.access EFS-02
           1.ec2-user
           2.mkdir efs
           3.yum install amazon-efs-utils -y
           4.then go to EFS and attach --mount via DNS
           5.then copy EFS mount helper and paste on the EFS-01
           6.ls
           7.cd efs
           8.ls

**EFS IN UBUNTU**


1.create a instance
       1.name--------EFS-01
       2.machine-----ubuntu
       3.sg----------ssh,http,https,nfs
       4.create a instance

2.create a instance
       1.name--------EFS-02
       2.machine-----ubuntu
       3.sg----------ssh,http,https,nfs
       4.create a instance

3.create a EFS
       1.name---efs
       2.customized
       3.attach our created sg

4.access the EFS-01
       1.apt update -y 
       2.apt install nfs-common
       3.mkdir -p efs/source
       4.go to efs---click on attach----click on mount via IP----copy these and paste on server and write at last ---efs/source
       5.cd efs
       6.cd source
       7.touch file{1..10}

5.access the EFS-02
       1.apt update -y 
       2.apt install nfs-common
       3.mkdir -p efs/source
       4.go to efs---click on attach----click on mount via IP----copy these and paste on server and write at last ---efs/source
       5.cd efs
       6.cd source
       7.ls
       8.touch bottol
       9.ls
