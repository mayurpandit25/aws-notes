      and supports advanced features such as content-based routing and host-based routing.
    3.Network Load Balancer (NLB) operates at the transport layer (TCP/UDP) i.e is the OSI model of layer 4 and is designed for
      high-performance, low-latency workloads.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14.How can you achieve high availability and fault tolerance with EC2?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17.What is the difference between a public IP address and an elastic IP address in EC2?
===>1.A public IP address is assigned to an EC2 instance by default when it is launched and can be used to access the instance 
      from the internet.a public IP address may change if an instance is stopped and started. 
    2.n elastic IP address (EIP) is a static, public IPv4 address that can be associated with an instance and persistently.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18.Can you explain the concept of VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and its relationship with EC2?
===>1.A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch resources, including 
      EC2 instances, in a virtual network environment defined by you. 
    2.It allows you to customize network settings, define subnets, configure routing tables, and control inbound/outbound traffic 
      using security groups and NACLs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26.What do you know about fleet management in Amazon EC2 auto-scaling?
====>This efficient serving computing resource automatically replaces unhealthy EC2 instances with new instances. Therefore, we can say
     that it continuously surveils the health of Amazon EC2 instances.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27. Provide a brief difference between terminating and stopping an EC2 instance method.
===>1.When you stop an instance, it means that the model shuts down, and again when you start the sample, the attached volumes to the
      instance remain attached.
    2.When you terminate an instance, it automatically deletes the EBS volumes attached; hence, the system can never restore it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

32. How can the EBS device be rebooted? 
===>Rebooting an Ebs device is like rebooting your PC, which means it does not affect your hard disk. Rebooting does not have any effect
    as such. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

33.What are the Benefits of Amazon EC2?
===>
1.Reliability: For each Amazon EC2 region, Amazon EC2 guarantees 99.9% availability. The services are extremely reliable, so instance replacement is simple and fast.
2.Security: Amazon uses Amazon VPC to provide the compute resources with stable networking and security. The compute instances are situated in a virtual private cloud   
   (VPC) with a specific IP range. This feature allows the user to choose which instances are visible on the internet and which are kept private.
3.Flexibility: You can select from a range of instance types, software packages, instance storages, and operating systems on EC2. EC2 helps one to configure the 
  memory, CPU, and boot partition sizes to suit the operating system and application.
4.Cost Saving: EC2 is cost-effective because it enables consumers to configure plans to suit their specific needs. This will allow the consumer to save money and make
  the most of their resources. The benefits of Amazon's scale are passed on to the consumer because EC2 charges a very low fee in relation to the services they offer.
5.Complete Computing Solution: Amazon RDS, S3, Dynamo DB, and Amazon SQS all work perfectly with EC2. This is a full-featured computing, processing, and storage soln.  
6.Elastic Web-Scale Computing:Within minutes, businesses can easily increase or decrease capacity. They can set up thousands of server instances at the same time. 
  Furthermore, all server instances are operated by web service APIs, which can scale the servers up and down based on the needs.
7.Completely controlled: Each instance can be granted root access, allowing users to interact with it as though it were any other computer. The user may use web     
 service APIs to stop the instance while keeping the data on the boot partition and restart it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

34.Why EC2 is Important?
===>1.No need for any hardware.
    2.Scalable up and down.
    3.Pay for what you use.
    4.Full control of the machine.
    5.Secure
    6.Accessible from anywhere in the world via internet-enabled devices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

35.Explain the Basic Structure of AWS Ec2 Service?
===>
1.Instances- Instances are servers hosted in the AWS cloud using the EC2 services.
2.AMI – AMI provides you the templates with an operating system and application pre-configured to reduce the chances of errors.
3.EBS- A block-level storage device that you can attach to a single EC2 instance, EBS volume is a durable way to increase disk space.
4.Security Group- A security group provides a way to block the traffic of a particular machine from other network-connected computers for the security of the EC2   instance.
5.IAM- Identity and Access Management, or IAM role, is used for managing access to AWS.
6.VPC- AWS’ Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows you to set up a virtual network that AWS resources can then join.
7.Load Balancers- Load Balancing distributes the incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP   addresses, in multiple Availability Zones.
8.Cloud Watch- The Amazon CloudWatch tool monitors all of your AWS resources and apps, collecting data and tracking variables in real-time.
